you understand the reality of life on this server: you are all puppets to an almighty sadistic dungeon master.
you delve too much into the number crunching in relation with atmospheric modelling and end up to 42.000 due to a rounding error.
you get convinced that an orgonite crystal will neutralize your second covid-19 jab.
well, yes, but actually no.
you attend a seminar given by a known fruity guru and try to find a hidden truth in the pips of a cucumber.
the library in you grandfather house is so large it lets you enter the L-space. You end up unable to find that copy of Hamlet without all the 'e'.
you find yourself tied -- alone -- to a tramway tracks. Luckily, the person operating the switch chose the other tracks. Unluckily, the creator of the tramway dilemma forgot about the third rail.
mandatory corporate events lead by your n+∞ (aka, his Fabiengness) are really not good for your sanity.
you try to connect to the server hosting the coffee machine and end up with a 418 error.
you look at a map of the USA and mixes Farhenreit and Celsius degrees, sending Las Vegas to hell for a dozen of days.
you realize that the communication in the organisation chart is so transverse axis symbiotic that you didn't know your n+6 was the Prime Minister of Latvia.
you face extra challenging circomstances due to covid-27 -- actually a 34th wave of covid-19 who mutated to infect mice and... Wait, you are a mouse now?
the complexity of the application landscape makes you misunderstand a Dutch-speaking friend and pour him some apple juice instead.
your attempts to calculate the helicoïdal movement of the spatio-temporal wells of Cygnus-alpha IV are met with a crushing scepticism among the planet's population. Indeed, due to a wrong assumption from your part, your calculations are off by 2 megaparsec/sA, crushing Cygnus alpha and turning it into supernova. But hey, assumptions are the mothers of all fuckups.
you are contacted by a madman attempting to reunite the elementary forces of physics. That went... Well, remember that Cygnus alpha incident? Yup, that's him.
