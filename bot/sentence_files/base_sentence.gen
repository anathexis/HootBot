your attempts to calculate the helicoïdal movement of the spatio-temporal wells of Cygnus-alpha IV are met with a crushing scepticism among the planet's population. Indeed, due to a wrong assumption from your part, your calculations are off by 2 megaparsec/sA, crushing Cygnus alpha and turning it into supernova. But hey, assumptions are the mothers of all fuckups.
you are contacted by a madman attempting to reunite the elementary forces of physics. That went... Well, remember that Cygnus alpha incident? Yup, that's him.

Due to the meta nature of that realization, you manage to win back 1 point of SAN in the process.
